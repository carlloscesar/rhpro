# Sistema RH Pro - Technical Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

Sistema RH Pro is a modern HR management system built with a full-stack JavaScript architecture. The application provides comprehensive human resources functionality through a web-based interface. This is a technical analysis dashboard that visualizes system architecture, performance metrics, security assessments, and code quality insights for the RH Pro system.

The dashboard itself is a static web application that presents analysis data about a React + Node.js + PostgreSQL HR system, displaying metrics, architectural decisions, and recommendations in an interactive format.

## User Preferences
